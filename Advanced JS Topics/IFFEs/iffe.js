//Iffe is a js function that gets executed as soon as its defined.
//It has two parts:
//  a. an anonymous function with lexical scope which is enclosed within
//     Grouping parameter (); this is the one which prevents accessing of any variable inside an IFFE.
//     thus global scope remains unpolluted.
//  b. immediately executed
